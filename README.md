# üó∫Ô∏è NYC Neighborhood Property Visualizer

A proof of concept web application that allows users to input a New York City address and visualize all properties within the corresponding neighborhood on an interactive map.

## Features (Planned)

* **Address Input**: User can enter any NYC address
* **Geocoding**: Convert the input address to geographic coordinates
* **Neighborhood Identification**: Determine the neighborhood containing the address
* **Property Visualization**: Display all properties within the identified neighborhood

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router
* **Mapping**: Mapbox GL JS
* **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
* **Data Processing**: Turf.js
